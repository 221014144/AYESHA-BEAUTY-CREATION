Our Story
Our drive to better your beauty routine sets the foundation for every Ayesha Beauty creation, a
Kamanjab village-based manufacturer in the Beauty, Personal Care, and Cosmetic sector. We are
looking to you and your every day for inspiration, then infusing the highest-quality ethically sourced
materials, indigenous ingredients, and technology to offer solutions you will revel in, using
knowledge shared over generations amongst Namibian matriarchs.
Every innovative beauty tool, texture, formula, and cosmetic colour makes your life easier, more
fun, and uniquely beautiful. Our products deeply moisturize, strengthen, stimulate growth, and
radiate a natural glow for all hair and skin textures.
Our female team has joined together, and we have not stopped developing new ways to transform
