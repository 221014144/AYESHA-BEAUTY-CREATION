 The readme file was supposed to show my updates previous edited but for some reason it does not, and my colleagues informed me yesterday. 
 As for our salon, a service portfolio is quite critical not only to customers but to investors as well. You need a professional salon portfolio. This portfolio includes pictures that show off your salon skills and talents to potential employers. The pictures can also attract new clients for your independent business.  And, this will assist with profit for the company and build on a way forward 


the following is our activity


Activity
Imagine you are hired as a Junior IT Consultant by Ayesha Beauty Creation to design them an
application for their daily operations based on the above story.
The desired outcome is the development of an application that:
• creates value for the business measured in financial returns per product/service portfolio,
• create efficiency in the human resource function,
• create customer relationship management database to serve as a sales tool.
You are required to design an application that Ayesha Beauty Creation can use. Kindly use the rubric
below to design the application.


lets use interview on empathise stage.
this is want i found on interviews the one i conducted, to people who works in salon and aswell ordinary people i found in around town of windhoek. 
it becomes challengs to some people  because often time  its very difficult for them to get the right quality product of their desire.some people don't have a specific product to use what ever comes. some said only one or  two company selling a specific product . some said some price is a big challenge where same product but difeerent price( price distortion.some they feel happy being their own boss.some have difficults to get loyal customers .



221014144 
after doing interviews,with different people working in salons, both male and female , and people working in human resources and sales and markerting, and management of different skin and hair products companies. i found out that customers want customer intimacy and companies want operational excellence. customers want their goods deliverd in time and they want good quality and affordable products. the products should be packaged in attractive containers.



my suggestion is to now create a pseudo code and flowchart of the application. 




221014144
we three departments(finance,human resources and customer)
we need to create a programme in:
1. finance: that create value in finance. 
2. human resources that create efficiency
3. customer that manages the customer database.

We will be making use of the application make the daily operations of the salon easier and efficient. 
The application will consist of different screens and optiooptions. 

221014144 the following is my pseudocode 

START 
prompt user for username and password 
get username and password
